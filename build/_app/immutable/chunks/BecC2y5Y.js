About two years ago i had the idea to do something with svelte and sveltekid seems to be a good framework to generate static blog websites.</p> <p>Also the time is right to create my ever first public webpresence (Github does not count).</p> <p>Also I wanted to do a coding project with neovim (loving it so far).</p> <p>Also I wanted to implement a used (and working) CI/CD pipeline…</p> <p>Also I wanted to improve my writing skills</p> <p>So you see, there are a lot of personal reasons, but we will see what the future holds.</p> <h1 id="what-is-the-concept">What is the concept?</h1> <p>Every project has some kind of concept in order to look, feel and do well nicely.
This website is/was created just for the “fun” of creating it and thus there is no direct concept which will structure everyting.
Maybe some tutorials will be posted, or just my very private diary entries. We will see. But there is a pressing feeling, that the first post will be hella informal ranting.</p> <h1 id="how-to-go-about-it">How to go about it…</h1> <p>At the time of writing this website is not yet fully implemented, but the basic layout is done.
To get started and to get into the flow, this first post is written preemtively, as it is on of my first hurdles (I feel no good about just starting with writing articles and sorts).\\
Mindmaps have and will come in handy in structuring the thoughts.</p> <p>Here is the basic timeline thought of, at the time of writing:</p> <ol><li>Implementation of blog features (mermaid/toc support)</li> <li>Finishing /about path (mindmap/implementation)</li> <li>Finishing / path (mindmap/implementation)</li> <li>Styling the light theme</li> <li>Finihing touches with the dark theme</li> <li>Rollout of the website</li> <li>CI/CD for new blogposts (enabling comments in the comment section)</li></ol> <h1 id="what-if-i-wanna-get-funky">What if I wanna get funky?</h1> <p>New ideas are never a problem. While writing, there came three new ideas, what to implement into this website.
But as the website needs to be published, I need to focus on a base set of features (listed before).</p> <p>Just to name three:</p> <ol><li>Voting System for the next blogpost</li> <li>Section for little implemented projects (including the projects, har har)</li> <li>Implementing plausible for this website</li></ol> <hr/> <p>So stay tuned for this website and maybe more blogposts…
